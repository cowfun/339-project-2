						Project Halo has recently discovered a new method in which we can farm the garbage crystal clusters floating in space and harness it to be used as fuel within our space crafts. These crystal clusters were once considered the trash of outer space, however with this discovery, we have found a way of recycling natures own trash into a byproduct which we can use. The research we have done on the crystal clusters show that the energy that we can use is three hundred percent stronger than traditional fuel while also being one hundred percent more clean. This is due to the fact that the clusters collapse into a fine powder which burns itself into nothingness. This creates a syster where there is not waste, nor any irreversible damage towards the environment.
					</p>

					<p class = "infoText">
						Although we are not quite certain where the clusters come from, there are theories that these formations are created when the dust particles in the atmosphere build up and burn while they are falling back down onto the planet. However, due to the relatively recent discovery of these formations, we cannot be 100% certain to how and where these objects actually come from.
					</p>

					<p class = "infoText">
						We can also confirm that with this new discovery, we will also be needing to hire Private Organizations in order to help us both acquire the clusters from the atmosphere, and synthesizing the clusters into usable fuel. If any company or peoples are interested in taking the job, please contact HALO as soon as possible.
