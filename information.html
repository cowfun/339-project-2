						Here at HALO, we believe in a vision where the human race controls every part of space which the human eye can see. At HALO not only have we created a fleet which can launch you anywhere you want, we have also created company which treats you as one of us. Regardless of your nationality, we want you to join us on our mission, to colonize the stars beyond our own.
					</p>

					<p class = "infoText">
						To simply put it, who are we? We are a you in essence, our corporation cannot run without the people, and as a corporation, we cannot expect to be trusted unless we give full transparency towards everyone. We have created an environment where we listen to the input of everyone, and offer the chance for everyone to join us.
					</p>

					<p class = "infoText">
						In order for us to reach the stars, we created a propulsion system which uses magnets in order to allow us to increase speed during flight, instead of decreasing speed while the craft is entering the atmosphere. This technology is more advanced than anything that the military has produced, and has given us an advantage to space travel compared to other companies in the business.

							<h4>Excellent Journey</h4>

							<p>Description is accurate; we liked the travelling experience, and private secition that was provided to us. Spacious, clean, neatly organized. The flight attendent seemed to be eager to help, although we did not need anything in this case. Nice company, I recommend it.</p>

							<h4>Great Service</h4>
							<div><img src="img/stars.png" width="80em"></div>
							<p>From the moment I stepped onto the ship, I knew that I was in for an amazing time. Everyone from the gate attendant to the flight attendants treated me like royalty. The pilot suffered from a little turbulance during the departure, but he definitely made up for it with the perfect landing. Overall a  great experience.</p>
