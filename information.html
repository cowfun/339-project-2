						Here at Project Halo, we envision a world in which the human race can travel anywhere their mind wants them too. And that is why we have developed the most powerful rockets in order to bring us to those places where we dream to go as kids. At Project Halo, we bring together the top scientist along with the most innovative engineers in order to create an experience that cannot be duplicated.
					</p>

					<p class = "infoText">
						The H-12 rockets are the most powerful rockets that can currently be created by human hands and materials from Earth. The first prototype, the H-1 rockets were created by scientists Calvin Hui and Irene Wang in the summer of 2018, during the cataclysmic war that occured. The two scientist were looking to create a propelling system that was capable of landing people that were affected by the war to other planets in order to start fresh. The technology behind the H Class rockets came from the theory of firing an object through magnetic forces which allows the object to pick up speed instead of losing speed while it is moving along the air.
